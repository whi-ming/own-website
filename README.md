# Welcome to my website
This will be little child that I will be working on continually. I will update the website depending on my current mood and outlook on things. A little section will be made to revert to prior versions of this website, as little catalog into my progression as a web developper. 

First iteration:
Jan 2024
Second time making a website for myself, first time not being for school. A heavy heavy inspiration was Les Animals' website at the time. The picture that was static and spanned the whole height came from them. The idea of revealing the bottom menu on-scroll was also from them. I hadn't liked web dev, but their website showed me how creative of a medium it actually is.
